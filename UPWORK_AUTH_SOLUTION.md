# Upwork API Authentication Solution

## The Problem

Your Upwork API credentials do NOT support Client Credentials Grant. This grant type is **only available for Enterprise accounts**.

## The Solution: Authorization Code Flow with Token Storage

Since you don't have an Enterprise account, we need to use the **Authorization Code Grant** flow. Here's how:

### Step 1: One-Time Authorization (Manual)
You'll authorize the app ONCE manually, and we'll store the tokens securely in Firestore.

### Step 2: Automatic Token Refresh
The tokens will be automatically refreshed by the library when they expire.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create a one-time setup script** that:
   - Generates an authorization URL
   - You visit the URL in your browser and approve
   - You copy the authorization code back
   - Script exchanges it for access/refresh tokens
   - Stores tokens in Firestore

2. **Update Cloud Function** to:
   - Load tokens from Firestore
   - Use them for API calls
   - Auto-refresh when expired
   - Save updated tokens back to Firestore

## Why This Works

- Authorization Code Grant works with all Upwork API accounts
- Refresh tokens allow long-term access without re-authorization
- The library handles token refresh automatically
- Cloud Function can use stored tokens

## Next Steps

I'll implement:
1. A setup script you run once locally
2. Updated Cloud Function that uses stored tokens
3. Automatic token refresh and storage
