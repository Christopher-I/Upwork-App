# Testing ChatGPT Scoring Integration

## ✅ What Was Changed

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`src/utils/scoring.ts`**
   - Made `calculateJobScore()` async
   - Added ChatGPT integration for 3 dimensions
   - Added automatic fallback to rule-based scoring if API fails
   - Created `calculateJobScoreSync()` for when AI is not needed

2. **`src/utils/mockData.ts`**
   - Updated to use async scoring with ChatGPT
   - Added detailed console logging to show AI scores
   - Shows EHR, Clarity, and Impact scores from ChatGPT

3. **`package.json`**
   - Added `openai: ^4.20.1` dependency

---

## 🚀 How to Test

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the OpenAI SDK.

---

### **Step 2: Add Your OpenAI API Key**

Edit `.env.local` and add your key:

```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

**Where to get your key:**
- Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key and paste it into `.env.local`

**Cost:** Each job costs ~$0.001-0.002 (0.1-0.2 cents), so testing 4 jobs = less than 1 cent

---

### **Step 3: Clear Old Mock Data**

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3002
3. Click **"Clear All"** button to remove old scores

---

### **Step 4: Add New Mock Data with ChatGPT**

1. Click **"Add Mock Data"** button
2. **Watch the browser console** (F12 → Console tab)

You should see output like this:

```

### **Step 5: Check the Scores**

Click on each job card to open the detail modal and verify:

#### **Job 1: Client Portal**
Expected improvements:
- **Score:** 85 → **90-92**
- **Business Impact:** 12 → **13-15** (ChatGPT recognizes "streamline", "communications")
- **Job Clarity:** 13 → **14-15** (ChatGPT counts more signals)
- **EHR:** $89/hr stays similar (10-13 pts)

#### **Job 2: Landing Page**
Expected improvements:
- **Score:** 82 → **85-88**
- **Business Impact:** 8 → **12-13** (ChatGPT recognizes "generate leads")
- **Job Clarity:** 15 stays perfect
- **EHR:** $100/hr stays at 13 pts

#### **Job 3: WordPress Fix**
Expected improvements:
- **Score:** 8 → **5-8**
- **EHR:** $83/hr → **$25/hr** ✅ **FIXED!** (3 pts instead of 10)
- **Business Impact:** 0 stays 0 (technical-only)
- **Job Clarity:** 3 stays low (vague)

## 🔍 What to Look For

### **✅ Good Signs:**

1. **Console shows:** `✅ ChatGPT scoring successful`
2. **Scores improved** for Jobs 1 & 2
3. **Job 3 EHR fixed:** Shows $25/hr (not $83/hr)
4. **Modal shows accurate data:**
   - Business Impact detects more outcomes
   - Job Clarity counts more boxes
   - EHR matches stated budget

### **⚠️ Warning Signs:**

1. **Console shows:** `⚠️ ChatGPT scoring failed, using rule-based fallback`
   - This means API key is missing or invalid
   - Scores will be same as before (rule-based)

2. **API errors:** Check if key is correct in `.env.local`

3. **Scores unchanged:** Make sure you cleared old data first

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "ChatGPT scoring failed"**

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env.local` has correct key
2. Restart dev server: `Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`
3. Check OpenAI account has credits: https://platform.openai.com/usage

---

### **Problem: "Module not found: openai"**

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install
```

---

### **Problem: Scores still look wrong**

**Solution:**
1. Clear all jobs first
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify ChatGPT is being called (look for `✅ ChatGPT scoring successful`)

---

## 📊 Expected Score Changes

| Job | Old Score | New Score | Main Improvements |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Client Portal** | 85/100 | **90-92/100** | +2-3 Business Impact, +1-2 Clarity |
| **Landing Page** | 82/100 | **85-88/100** | +4-5 Business Impact |
| **WordPress Fix** | 8/100 | **5-8/100** | -7 EHR (fixed calculation) |

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **1. EHR Calculation Fixed** ✅
- **Before:** Ignored stated budget, used generic $2500/30hrs
- **After:** Reads "Budget $50, 1-2 hours" → Calculates $25/hr correctly

### **2. Business Impact Smarter** ✅
- **Before:** Strict keyword matching ("streamline" missed)
- **After:** Understands context and business language

### **3. Job Clarity More Accurate** ✅
- **Before:** Simple word matching missed multi-word signals
- **After:** Semantic understanding counts "secure login" as one signal

---

## 💰 Cost Analysis

**Cost per scoring:**
- gpt-4o-mini: ~$0.001-0.002 per job
- 4 mock jobs: < $0.01 (less than 1 cent)

**For production use:**
- 100 jobs/day: ~$0.10-0.20/day
- 3000 jobs/month: ~$3-6/month

**Very affordable!**

---

## 🔄 Fallback Behavior

If ChatGPT fails (no API key, rate limit, error), the system **automatically falls back** to rule-based scoring:

```typescript
try {
  aiScores = await scoreJobWithChatGPT(...);
  console.log('✅ ChatGPT scoring successful');
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('⚠️ ChatGPT failed, using rule-based fallback');
  // Uses original scoring functions
}
```

**This means:**
- App never breaks due to AI issues
- Graceful degradation
- Still functional without API key

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

After testing, you should see:

1. ✅ All 4 jobs score successfully
2. ✅ Job 1 & 2 scores improved (higher total)
3. ✅ Job 3 EHR fixed ($25/hr not $83/hr)
4. ✅ Console shows "ChatGPT scoring successful"
5. ✅ Modal shows accurate business outcomes
6. ✅ Job Clarity shows more boxes ticked
