## DIMENSION 1: EHR POTENTIAL (15 points max)

**Goal:** Estimate realistic project price, hours, and resulting effective hourly rate (EHR).

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 15 pts: EHR $100+/hr
- 13 pts: EHR $80-99/hr
- 10 pts: EHR $60-79/hr
- 7 pts: EHR $40-59/hr
- 3 pts: EHR below $40/hr

**CRITICAL: Estimation Rules - ALWAYS USE FAIR MARKET VALUE PRICING**

**The goal is to estimate what YOU could charge for this project at professional Fair Market Value, NOT what the client is offering!**

**FOR ALL JOBS:**

1. **STEP 1 - Estimate Hours Based on Scope:**
   - Analyze the project requirements carefully
   - Use the hour estimation guidelines below
   - Be realistic about the actual time required

2. **STEP 2 - Estimate Fair Market Value:**

Estimate what a professional web development agency would charge for this project. Consider these factors:

**A. Base Scope Analysis:**
   - How many pages/screens/features are described?
   - Template-based or fully custom build?
   - What's the core functionality being requested?
   - Is there existing work/assets mentioned (mockups, content, designs)?

**B. Complexity Multipliers - Look for these signals:**
   - Custom API integrations or third-party systems
   - User authentication, roles, and permissions
   - Database design and custom data architecture
   - Scalability requirements ("scalable", "high-traffic", "performance")
   - Security and compliance mentions (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, "secure", "compliance")
   - Multi-stakeholder coordination (investors, departments, teams)
   - Real-time features, websockets, or advanced interactivity

**C. Client Type Signals - These indicate higher budgets:**
   - **Agency/Intermediary** ("my client needs", "our client", "for a client"):
     → Expect 1.5-2x standard rates (agency markup built into budget)

   - **Government/Institutional** ("government", "ministry", "agency", "university"):
     → Expect 2-3x standard rates (procurement processes, compliance, stakeholder complexity)

   - **Enterprise** ("enterprise", "corporation", "multiple departments"):
     → Expect 2-4x standard rates (enterprise complexity, legal, procurement)

   - **Small Business/Individual** (default):
     → Standard professional rates

**D. Professional Requirement Signals - These increase value:**
   - Tight deadlines with specific dates
   - "Already invested" signals ("have mockups", "have designs", "hired designer")
   - Previous developer failed ("tried before", "didn't work out", "redo")
   - Formal requirements (NDA, SOW, deliverables, milestones mentioned)
   - Geographic restrictions ("US-based only", "North America only") = premium rates
   - Explicit premium language ("willing to pay higher", "quality over cost")

**REAL EXAMPLES for Calibration:**

Use these real-world examples to calibrate your estimates. Don't fit jobs into categories - assess the actual scope.

**Example 1: Simple Landing Page**
Description: "Need a 3-page landing page with contact form for my startup"
→ Estimate: $2,000-3,000
→ Reasoning: 10-15 hours, standard small business rates ($150-200/hr effective)

**Example 2: Small Business Website**
Description: "8-page website for law firm, need CMS, contact forms, blog, testimonials"
→ Estimate: $8,000-12,000
→ Reasoning: 40-60 hours, professional services client, clear requirements

**Example 3: E-commerce Store**
Description: "Shopify store with 50 products, custom checkout flow, inventory management"
→ Estimate: $15,000-25,000
→ Reasoning: 80-120 hours, e-commerce complexity, custom features beyond template

**Example 4: Custom Portal (Mid-Range)**
Description: "Client portal for video company, file sharing, project status, user accounts"
→ Estimate: $25,000-40,000
→ Reasoning: 120-180 hours, custom development, user management, file handling

**Example 5: Agency Custom LMS (High-Value) - REAL JOB**
Description: "My team and I have a client that needs custom learning site. Already have mockups and tons of content. Transform Webflow LMS template but have additional things we want. Looking for US-based only."
→ Actual Value: $70,000
→ Reasoning:
  - Agency hiring for client (1.5-2x multiplier)
  - Already invested (mockups, content = serious budget)
  - Custom beyond template
  - US-based only (premium rate requirement)
  - 300-400 hours at premium rates

**Example 6: Government Platform (High-Value) - REAL JOB**
Description: "Interactive online platform to track climate change resilience metrics for Caribbean government. Features: CMS, visual scorecard, interactive database, decision-making tool, analytics. Requirements: Degree, years of experience, government client experience. Scalable, secure, open source preferred. Multi-stakeholder (investors + government)."
→ Actual Value: $50,000
→ Reasoning:
  - Government client (2-3x multiplier)
  - Multi-stakeholder complexity (investors + government)
  - Formal requirements (degree, experience)
  - Professional infrastructure (scalable, secure)
  - Complex feature set (CMS + scorecard + database + analytics)
  - 200-250 hours at government rates

**Example 7: Enterprise Integration Portal**
Description: "Need enterprise portal with Salesforce integration, SSO authentication, role-based access, compliance with SOC2, support 500+ users, scalable architecture"
→ Estimate: $100,000-150,000
→ Reasoning:
  - Enterprise client (2-4x multiplier)
  - Enterprise system integration (Salesforce)
  - Compliance requirements (SOC2)
  - Scalability for large user base
  - 400-600 hours at enterprise rates

**CRITICAL PRICING RULES:**

1. **No Artificial Caps**: If scope and signals warrant $100K+, estimate $100K+. Don't artificially limit estimates.

2. **Ignore Client's Budget**: The client's stated budget should have ZERO impact on your fair market value estimate.

3. **Apply Multipliers**: Government/agency/enterprise are NOT just "more hours" - they have fundamentally higher budgets:
   - Agency: 1.5-2x (they have client budget + markup)
   - Government: 2-3x (procurement, compliance, stakeholders)
   - Enterprise: 2-4x (enterprise complexity, legal, procurement)

4. **"Already Invested" = Higher Total**: If they mention "have mockups", "tried previous developer", this is often phase 2 of a larger budget.

3. **STEP 3 - Calculate EHR:**
   - EHR = estimatedPrice (Fair Market Value) ÷ estimatedHours
   - This shows the ACTUAL earning potential per hour
   - Example: Government platform worth $50,000 ÷ 220 hours = $227/hr EHR

4. **Hour Estimation Guidelines:**

**Small Projects:**
- Quick fix/small task: 1-5 hours
- Simple landing page (1-3 pages): 10-20 hours
- Multi-page website (5-10 pages): 30-50 hours

**Medium Projects:**
- Website with CMS/blog (10+ pages): 40-70 hours
- E-commerce store (template + customization): 60-100 hours
- Simple portal/dashboard: 50-80 hours

**Large Projects:**
- Custom web app/portal with features: 100-200 hours
- Complex portal with integrations: 150-300 hours
- Government/institutional platform: 200-350 hours
- Enterprise multi-stakeholder system: 300-600 hours

**IMPORTANT:**
- Government/agency projects need MORE hours (stakeholder meetings, revisions, approvals)
- "Already have mockups" doesn't reduce hours - it means they want MORE custom work
- Tight deadlines don't reduce hours - same work in less time
- Be honest about time required - don't artificially reduce to inflate EHR

**Output Required:**
- score: 0-15
- estimatedPrice: Your best estimate in USD
- estimatedHours: Your best estimate
- estimatedEHR: Calculated rate (rounded)
- reasoning: 1-2 sentences explaining your estimates

## DIMENSION 2: JOB CLARITY (15 points max)

**Goal:** How well-defined is the job? How many "boxes" are ticked?

**IMPORTANT:** Focus on clarity and planning signals. Light platform mentions (Webflow, Shopify) are fine, but AVOID rewarding deeply technical requirements like bug fixes, PRs, technical specifications, or jobs that sound like they were written by/for developers.

**Count These Signals:**

**Platform Signals (LIGHT technical mentions only - max 2 points):**
- Platforms/tools: webflow, shopify, wordpress (these are good)
- High-level features: portal, dashboard, landing page, cms, blog
- DO NOT count: specific frameworks, version numbers, technical jargon, bug fixes, PRs

**Clarity Signals (PRIMARY - these show professional planning):**
- Specific quantities: "5 pages", "10 sections", "8-10 pages"
- Timeline: "3 weeks", "by January", "flexible timeline"
- Scope definition: clear deliverables, phases, milestones
- Quality descriptors: "professional", "modern", "clean", "high-quality"
- Requirements: "mobile responsive", "lead capture forms", "secure login"
- Context: describes current situation, why they need this

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 15 pts: 7+ clarity signals + light platform mentions (highly professional)
- 14 pts: 5-6 clarity signals (well-planned)
- 13 pts: 3-4 clarity signals (decent planning)
- 10 pts: 2 clarity signals (some structure)
- 7 pts: 1 clarity signal (minimal)
- 3 pts: 0 clarity signals OR heavily technical (vague or tech-focused)

**PENALTY:** If job mentions bug fixes, pull requests, technical specs, or deep technical requirements → reduce score by 3-5 points (cap at 3 pts minimum)

**Output Required:**
- score: 0-15
- technicalMatches: Count of LIGHT platform mentions (webflow, shopify, etc.)
- clarityMatches: Count of planning/clarity signals found
- totalMatches: Sum of both (but clarity signals weighted higher)
- reasoning: List the actual clarity signals you found

---

## DIMENSION 3: BUSINESS IMPACT (15 points max)

**Goal:** Does this solve a business problem or just hire a coder?

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DIMENSION - We prefer business outcomes over technical tasks.**

**Strong Business Outcomes (look for these FIRST):**
1. **Revenue outcomes:** leads, sales, conversions, customers, bookings, revenue, generate, acquire
2. **Efficiency outcomes:** save time, automate, streamline, reduce, faster, organize, manage, simplify
3. **Growth outcomes:** scale, grow, expand, increase, improve, boost, enhance, launch
4. **Metrics outcomes:** track, analytics, reporting, KPI, measure, insights
5. **Customer/Client impact:** improve experience, satisfy customers, serve clients better

**Business Context (strong positive signal):**
- "our business", "our company", "our team", "our clients", "help us", "we need"
- Describes current business pain point or goal
- Explains WHY they need this (not just WHAT they need)

**MAJOR Red Flags (Technical-Only - heavily penalize):**
- "need developer", "need programmer", "looking for developer/coder"
- "must know [technology]", "experience in [framework]", "skilled in [language]"
- Bug fixes, pull requests (PRs), technical specifications
- Focus on technical requirements instead of business outcomes
- Reads like a job description for a developer role
- Heavy technical jargon that sounds like it was written by/for developers

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 15 pts: 3+ outcome categories + clear business context (strong business focus)
- 13 pts: 2-3 outcome categories + some context (good business focus)
- 10 pts: 1-2 outcome categories (some business awareness)
- 5 pts: Vague outcomes or mostly technical with minor business mention
- 0 pts: Technical-only job (hiring a developer, not solving a problem)

**Special Rule:** If ANY technical-only red flags detected (bug fixes, PRs, "need developer", heavy tech specs) AND no clear business outcomes → score = 0

**Output Required:**
- score: 0-15
- detectedOutcomes: Array of specific outcome phrases found (e.g., "generate leads", "streamline communications")
- isTechnicalOnly: true if this is a technical-task job (red flags present, no business context)
- reasoning: Explain what business outcomes were found OR why it's technical-only

---

## DIMENSION 4: SKILLS MATCH (15 points max)

**Goal:** Does this job require platforms or skills that match the freelancer's expertise?

**MY CORE SKILLS:**
${userSkills?.coreSkills?.join(', ') || 'Custom web apps, Framer, Webflow, React, TypeScript, Next.js, Firebase, Supabase, TailwindCSS, portals, dashboards, landing pages, API integrations'}

**FLAGGED PLATFORMS (Auto-score 0 if PRIMARY requirement):**
${userSkills?.flaggedPlatforms?.join(', ') || 'GoHighLevel, GHL, Bubble.io, Bubble'}

**Detection Rules:**

1. **PRIMARY vs. SECONDARY Mentions:**
   - PRIMARY (heavily penalize):
     * Platform name in job title (e.g., "GHL Expert Needed")
     * Platform in requirements section (e.g., "Must have GoHighLevel experience")
     * Platform mentioned 3+ times in description
     * Phrases like "expert in [platform]", "proven experience with [platform]"

   - SECONDARY (don't penalize):
     * Single mention in "nice to have"
     * Mentioned as one option among many (e.g., "Webflow, Bubble, or similar")

2. **Platform Detection:**
   - Scan for exact platform names (case-insensitive)
   - Also check common abbreviations (GHL = GoHighLevel)
   - Look for context: "looking for X developer", "need X expert", "X specialist"

3. **Skills Matching:**
   - Check if job requirements mention MY CORE SKILLS
   - Count matched vs. mismatched skills
   - Identify if job is in my wheelhouse or completely different domain

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 15 pts: Perfect match - job explicitly mentions 2+ of MY CORE SKILLS, no flagged platforms
- 13 pts: Strong match - job aligns with web dev/design, mentions 1 core skill
- 10 pts: Adjacent match - general web work, no specific platform requirements
- 5 pts: Partial mismatch - mentions flagged platform as "nice to have" OR secondary mention
- 0 pts: Major mismatch - flagged platform is PRIMARY requirement (3+ mentions, in title, or in requirements)

**Special Rules:**
- If flagged platform appears in job title → automatic score = 0
- If job says "must have [flagged platform]" → automatic score = 0
- If flagged platform mentioned 3+ times → automatic score = 0
- If job is for backend/mobile/DevOps/data engineering (outside my core) → cap at 5 pts max

**Output Required:**
- score: 0-15
- detectedPlatforms: Array of all platforms/tools mentioned in job (e.g., ["GoHighLevel", "Zapier", "React"])
- matchedSkills: Array of MY CORE SKILLS that appear in job description (e.g., ["React", "Webflow"])
- mismatchedSkills: Array of required skills NOT in my core skillset (e.g., ["GoHighLevel", "Bubble.io"])
- isPrimaryMismatch: true if flagged platform is PRIMARY requirement (will show red warning badge)
- reasoning: Explain why you gave this score, what platforms were detected, and whether it's a good fit
