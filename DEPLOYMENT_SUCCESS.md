## 📊 View Logs

To see what's happening in the Cloud Function:

```bash
firebase functions:log
```

Or view in Firebase Console:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/upwork-monitor-app/functions/logs

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No jobs appearing?

1. **Check the browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
   - Look for errors
   - See API call results

2. **Check Cloud Function logs**:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --only fetchUpworkJobs
   ```

3. **Verify API key is working**:
   - Test your Upwork API key directly
   - Make sure it has the right permissions

### Error: "Upwork API key not configured"

The key is configured! But if you see this:
```bash
firebase functions:config:get
```

Should show your API key. If not, run:
```bash
firebase functions:config:set upwork.api_key="df88a3a8224d980f27d9fd04bc50e903"
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### CORS errors?

These should be gone now! The Cloud Function handles all API calls server-side.
