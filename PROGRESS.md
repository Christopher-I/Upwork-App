## ⏳ What You Need To Do Now

### 1. Get NEW API Keys (10 minutes)

Your `.env.local` file has placeholders for these keys. You need to get FRESH keys (don't reuse the exposed ones):

#### Upwork API Key:
1. Go to: https://www.upwork.com/developer/
2. Click "Get API Keys"
3. Create new app: "Job Assistant v2"
4. Copy API Key + Secret
5. Open `.env.local` and replace:
   ```bash
   VITE_UPWORK_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
   VITE_UPWORK_API_SECRET=your_actual_secret_here
   ```

#### OpenAI API Key:
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Name: "Job Assistant v2"
4. Copy key immediately
5. Add $10-20 credits to your account
6. Open `.env.local` and replace:
   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_key_here
   ```

### 2. Test The App (2 minutes)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

**You should see:** "Upwork Job Assistant" page with "Project setup complete!"

## 🎯 Next: I'll Build Phase 1

Once you've added your API keys and confirmed the app runs, tell me:

**"Keys added, ready for Phase 1"**

Then I'll build:

### Phase 1 Tasks (2-3 days)
1. ✅ Firebase integration (DONE)
2. ⏳ Upwork API client with rate limiter
3. ⏳ Scoring algorithm (all 6 dimensions)
4. ⏳ Duplicate detection
5. ⏳ Cloud Functions setup
6. ⏳ Dashboard UI
7. ⏳ Job detail modal

**Milestone:** Click "Refresh" → See 18 recommended jobs with scores

## 🔐 Security Check

- ✅ `.env.local` created
- ✅ `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Firebase keys added
- ⏳ Upwork keys (waiting for you)
- ⏳ OpenAI key (waiting for you)

**Important:** Never commit `.env.local` to git!

## ⏭️ Ready?

1. Add Upwork API key to `.env.local`
2. Add OpenAI API key to `.env.local`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Tell me: "Ready for Phase 1"

I'll then build the complete Upwork integration! 🚀
